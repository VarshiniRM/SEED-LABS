üìö Overview:
Discovered in October 2016, Dirty COW (CVE-2016-5195) impacts nearly all Linux-based systems. It allows unprivileged users to gain write access to read-only memory mappings by exploiting a race condition between the madvise() and write() system calls.

üìù SEED Labs: Format String Vulnerability | Exploiting Input Validation Flaws
This repository demonstrates the exploitation of Format String Vulnerabilities based on the SEED Labs format. The lab highlights how improperly validated user input can lead to memory corruption, information disclosure, and potential code execution.

üìö Overview:
A Format String Vulnerability occurs when user input is improperly passed to functions like printf(), sprintf(), or snprintf() that expect format specifiers (e.g., %s, %x, %n) to control output formatting. When an attacker controls the format string, they can manipulate the program‚Äôs behavior, often leading to security exploits such as stack manipulation, leakage of sensitive data, and arbitrary code execution.

Identify potential areas where user input can influence the output format and memory operations

Demonstrate how improper validation allows attackers to control the format string

‚úÖ Task 2: Exploit the Format String Vulnerability

Use format specifiers (e.g., %x, %s, %n) to leak sensitive data such as stack addresses

Perform a stack-based buffer overflow using %n to write arbitrary values to memory addresses

Exploit the vulnerability to alter program behavior and gain unauthorized access

‚úÖ Task 3: Prevent Format String Vulnerabilities

Employ security measures like stack canaries and format string checks to mitigate risks

üß† Key Concepts:

Format String Vulnerabilities: Understanding how format specifiers work and how improper input handling can lead to attacks
